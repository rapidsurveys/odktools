Data collection using computer-assisted personal interviewing or CAPI
tools is now the standard approach for conducting surveys and studies. A
wide range of CAPI systems are currently being used. The ability to
interface with these systems helps in the overall data process. This
package provides interface functions to CAPI systems based on the [Open
Data Kit or ODK](https://getodk.org) technology.
